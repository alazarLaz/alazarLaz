# Hi ðŸ‘¾, I'm Alazar Yehualashet
  

I am a  web developper **wannabe** with a good grasp of javascript, c and python
I am currently learning react. 
I love learning new things (a bit too much). I am a self-learner trying to someday contribute to the development
of solid solutions for some world's major problems.
Welcome to my personal GitHub. Here I put my spaghetti code and stuff. 
May you find something you like.
